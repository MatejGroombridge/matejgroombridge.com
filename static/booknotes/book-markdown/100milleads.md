## The Book in 3 Sentences

1. Advertising is defined as letting strangers know what you sell, meaning that if you are struggling to get customers the root cause is almost always that you aren't advertising enough.
2. To generate engaged leads, you must master four channels - warm outreach, cold outreach, free content and paid ads - while using high-value lead magnets to solve narrow problems for your audience.
3. Success is ultimately an inputs and outputs game that requires massive volume and deciding to never let a lack of effort be the reason you fail.

## Overview & Impressions

$100M Leads is a fantastic guide that demystifies the art of getting strangers to buy your stuff. I found this book to be incredibly concise, actionable and a solid all-rounder for anyone trying to scale a business. Hormozi breaks everything down into the "Core Four" - warm outreach, cold outreach, paid ads, and content - which frames lead generation as a inputs and outputs game rather than a creative struggle. It’s a bit intense in its demand for volume, telling you to give up on doing your best and just do what is required. Ultimately it points to the fact that if you aren’t getting enough leads it's just because you’re not advertising enough. Would recommend.
