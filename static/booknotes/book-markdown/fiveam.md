## The Book in 3 Sentences

1.  The 5AM Club is a morning routine developed by Robin Sharma wherein you rise at 5am and perform 20 minutes of exercise, 20 minutes reflecting on your goals and 20 minutes learning a new skill.
2.  A structured and consistent morning routine which starts at 5am can act as a catalyst for greater productivity, health, and happiness.
3.  By owning your morning, you elevate your life.

## Impressions

Robin Sharma’s “The 5AM Club,” presents the revolutionary habit of an early-morning routine in an engaging and insightful manner. Written as a fictitious story, the book follows two adults as they learn the secrets of “The 5AM Club.” Whilst the narrative style does make the information more engaging and sticky, I can definitely understand how it might be annoying for some people to get through. The characters were quite shallow and followed very cliché development arcs. I think the 5AM Club could have been distilled into a significantly shorter work of non-fiction. However, the information presented is sound and whilst it markets itself as a “book about waking up early,” The 5AM Club manages to teach the essentials of productivity/self-improvement and impart a lot of extra wisdom which I found surprising and valuable. A great read if you want to elevate your quality of life.

### 5 Rules for waking up early:

2.  Excuses breed no genius. Just because you haven’t installed the early-rising habit before doesn’t mean you can’t do it now. Release your rationalizations and remember that small daily improvements, when done consistently over time, lead to stunning results.
3.  All change is hard at first, messy in the middle and gorgeous at the end. Everything you now find easy you first found difficult. With consistent practice, getting up with the sun will become your new normal. And automatic.
4.  To have the results the top 5% of producers have, you must start doing what 95% of people are unwilling to do. As you start to live like this, the majority will call you crazy. Remember that being labeled a freak is the price of greatness.
