## Impressions

*The Surrender Experiment* is an autobiography that delves into the life of author, speaker and former tech CEO Michael Singer in order to illustrate the extraordinary things that can happen when we stop pushing for the things we think we want. It was certainly a very different read compared to a lot of the other books I’ve read recently but I found it quite interesting. Whilst it is a non-fiction book, the text is written as a story so it was a very engaging read. Obviously this is a very spiritual book so I take everything with a grain of salt - but even if you don’t agree with the ideas that *The Surrender Experiment* perpetuates, this book provides a very unique and refreshing perspective on life that you can adapt to fit your needs. A great introduction to spirituality.

No matter who we are, life is going to put us through the changes we need to go through. The question is: Are we willing to use this force for our transformation? I saw that even very intense situations don't have to leave psychological scars, if we are willing to process our changes at a deeper level.

> A great spiritual teacher once said, “Every day bite off more than you can chew, and chew it.”
