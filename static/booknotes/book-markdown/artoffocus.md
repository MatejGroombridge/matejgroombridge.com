## The Book in 3 Sentences

1. Western society and biological evolution have designed humans to follow the path of least resistance, leading to a life of distraction and entropy unless we apply the conscious energy of focus to bring order to our lives.
2. The book introduces a 2x2 framework for attention, arguing that we must oscillate between conscious narrow focus (execution/flow) and conscious open focus (creativity/peace) to avoid the anxiety and stress caused by unconscious habits.
3. To reclaim autonomy, one must become a value creator by solving their own problems, documenting the process through a skill stack of writing and marketing and turning those solutions into a niche-of-one business.

## Overview & Impressions

The Art of Focus is a very enlightening read that feels like a survival guide for the modern mind. Dan Koe blends philosophy, spirituality, psychology and sociology to create a cohesive argument for why attention is the most valuable currency we possess. There is a large focus on becoming a creator in the creator economy, framing entrepreneurship not just as a way to make money but as a vessel for self-actualisation and solving one's own problems. I found that if anything, the book covers too much ground - jumping from the physics of entropy to the tactics of writing and sales - making it quite dense. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, though the book can be hard to digest at times. Potentially a transformative read and a great synthesis of disparate philosophical, spiritual and business ideologies.

# Summary, Quotes & Notes

We are at a pivotal moment in human evolution. Attention spans are shrinking. Bodies are getting softer. Minds are growing weaker.

Western society– is designed not by man, but by years of evolution to keep you in chains. A slave to the system.

Our choices are not our own, and our choices create who we are.

You cannot understand freedom if you do not conquer what made you a slave.

If you do not have the awareness of the possibility of a better life, it is impossible for such a future to actualize.

With the advancements in technology, medicine, and decentralization, anybody can build wealth, leverage, and an overwhelming sense of satisfaction in life.

Humans can process 10– 50 bits of information per second with their conscious attention.

Focus is attention with intention.

The unconscious mind can manage eleven million bits of information per second.

We are attacking the root cause of your problems through focus.

Testing new techniques, forging your own path, and “figuring it out” are deeply spiritual experiences.

Masters rarely need methods given to them. They prioritize high-level understanding, experiment with various techniques, and craft a strategy that allows them to navigate large and small situations with grace.

Entropy is the supreme law of the universe, which illustrates that systems tend toward disorder, chaos, and destruction on all planes of existence unless energy is put into the system.

When you understand the goal, process, and variables of any situation, your mind can perceive that situation in a manner that is conducive toward your desired outcome.

Clarity is your savior, and we must prioritize programming, maintaining, and evolving the systems our mind runs on.

The structure of the information that fills our consciousness impacts how we move in the world.

To zoom out, like a camera, is to broaden your perspective to interpret a situation for what it is.

Experimentation leads to true experience, and true experience is how you differentiate yourself in the marketplace.

We imitate everything around us for the sake of survival.

The way you begin to move in a life direction is to make a conscious change in the people, environments, and information that you are exposed to.

Some of the deepest truths are hidden under what seems to be silly on the surface. Open- mindedness is how you explore the depths, while most people exist on the surface.

No idea is too sacred to question, and the more sacred it seems, the more it should be questioned.

Question the things that people make you think you are crazy for questioning. That is the beginning of many inspiring origin stories.

Don’t judge things that you have not experienced.

The space between expectation and reality is tension, pain, and suffering.

We often interpret a situation as difficult when it isn’t supposed to be any other way. It is what it is, and once you experience this profound truth, life becomes sustainably more enjoyable.

A concept is used to label an experience, yet people latch onto concepts and act like they understand to survive the identity they’ve formed.

Things aren’t supposed to be anything other than what they are, and once you accept this, expectation aligns with reality.

One can know a lot but understand very little. Knowledge is constructed upward, while understanding is discovered inward.

Knowledge must be acquired, but in order to understand, it must be brushed up against reality to see if it holds its weight.

the only way to make novel discoveries, creations, and innovations is to embrace the unknown, preferably with curiosity as your driver toward a meaningful goal.

Reality is not compartmentalized. Everything is connected, and there are infinite connections to be made.

The world needs more polymaths, autodidacts, and modern Renaissance men to further the unity of human consciousness.

we want to leverage the efficiency of our minds, systemize mechanical tasks to take up the least amount of time in our day, and make time for creative pursuits.

Stories house the components that form the foundation of human behavior.

There is a problem, call to adventure, curiosity, exploration of the unknown, struggle, insight, transformation, solution, climax, and more that happen more than once over the course of a lifetime.

Success cannot exist without failure.

Value requires development over time.

It is wise to try new things, and I would recommend adopting that habit, but you need a project to develop. Without a tangible vessel for your knowledge, skill acquisition, and discoveries, you may end up with years of energy spent with nothing to show for it.

Reality is not black and white.

Reality is perspective, and your perspective is but one of infinite.

If you are a truth seeker, your job is to hunt for kernels of truth in every perspective, even those that aren’t human. This forces you to reject all ideology, dogma, or belief system that even the masters may hold as absolute truth.

You don’t get rid of the ego; you develop it to the point of being at one with reality.

You must shed your attachment to expectations, concepts, and beliefs that prevent you from perceiving any situation for what it is.

When you can perceive a situation for what it is, you can acquire the skill necessary to match the challenge that a problem presents. This is done with self- education, self- experimentation, and persistence to see that the problem is solved not by the prescription of another, but by your own understanding.

The human psyche is interesting in that we survive and reproduce on a conceptual level. We impregnate minds with ideas, those ideas create concepts, we may identify with those concepts, and our behavior shifts in alignment with those.

Mastery sets you apart in a world that can’t see beyond the surface.

To the masters, repetition of the boring fundamentals is not boring.

Tactical stress is the conscious decision to break out of your familiar routine, put yourself in a do- or- die situation, and realize that the only thing stopping you from reaching the next level is fear.

In business, close the client even if you don’t know with certainty that you can deliver results. In life, book the flight across the country even if you don’t think you can afford it. Make the decision that requires you to finally execute reaching your next stage of evolution.

Strip all judgments from your mind surrounding selfishness, as I’m assuming those were programmed into your head by the selfish desires of others.

Every successful person – by any standard, even if that version of success means rejecting the world and living a life of peace in the woods – knows that focus is the catalyst to the good life.

Focus is a muscle, and success is reserved for those that train it.

Attention is the currency that runs the world. It is the foundation of existence. If it doesn’t occupy your attention, it doesn’t exist.

In a modern sense, businesses can only exchange money if attention comes first.

The attention needed to make a decision can only be done after you give attention to a thought about that action.

Your hierarchy of goals, from the top down, ideal future to present action, will frame your focus in an indistractable manner.

“Energy flows where attention goes.”

Thoughts, emotions, goals, environments, art, tasks, conversations, experiences, and the rest trigger an energy that you can feel.

The law of entropy finds that everything falls into chaos, or that nothing lasts forever.

No matter how much mental energy I use to keep my books in order on the shelf, entropy will take its grasp.

No matter how efficient a system is, it will always fall to the law of entropy.

A system is a group of components that work together to achieve a common goal.

The mind is a complex set of systems that allows us to interact with reality.

Human behavior is influenced by a desirable goal, system to achieve that goal, and a problem that once made conscious pushes people to act. The degree of clarity that this process provides will influence how people perceive the goal. That is, whether it is worth pursuing or not.

If you don’t know what you want, you will be told what you want, and you will believe it.

The interplay of culture, society, and survival place multiple hierarchies of goals in front of us. Go to school, get good grades, praise the god you subscribe to, watch the news to stay informed, and retire when you have enough to scrape by with the little time you have left.

Collective mental energy is what creates modern power.

But if we don’t want to be victims of mental entropy, we must create, improve, and allow for the evolution of systems to aid in our personal development.

To sustain maximum enjoyment, you need ample experience.

What is experience? It is what’s right in front of you.

Everything outside of the present moment is not direct experience, but an experience of the experience, which can spiral into overthinking, overwhelm, and overanalysis.

This can be useful in moderation with a tool like self- reflection, and should be a practice in your life, but you may miss out on the only thing that’s real.

You will have to face problems that, when fixed, will threaten your conceptual understanding of who you are.

The path of the problem solver, or value creator, is how you escape the world of replaceability.

We don’t differ too much in genetic code but our minds, worldview, biases, interests, goals, upbringing, geographical location, and all of the moment- to- moment inputs we’ve experienced is my point.

There is no one-size-fits-all ideology.

Every truth is a half- truth in the relative world, and every relative perspective points a finger toward the absolute.

You cannot take ideas, opinions, or advice as law without the filter of direct experience.

Start identifying your problems that make life less enjoyable. Seek to understand how you can fix those problems. When you do, learn how to fix them, and fall in love with this process.

Success in life, business, relationships, and health is about solving a never- ending string of problems that gets better– and more rewarding– with time.

There seems to be 2 polar ends of focus that result in an above- average experience. (1) Radical narrow focus on the task in front of you. Doing. (2) Radical open focus that grasps at nothing. Being.

The Greeks made the distinction between “telic” and “atelic” activities. That is, activities that have a goal and activities that don’t.

Autotelic activities are self- contained. They are done without expectation of a desired outcome. The reward is in the contradictory nature of the activity that combines both absolute being and absolute doing.

The key to maximum enjoyment is to be where you want to be while doing what you want to do.

You can experience this range from an unconscious or conscious state of mind.

Unconscious narrow focus leads to feelings like stress, anxiety, and annoyance. Like when a rogue thought about a stressful future pops into your head.

Unconscious open focus leads to feeling lost, overwhelmed, and uncertain. If you project into a future that you don’t have clarity to reach, the task of consistent execution seems daunting.

Conscious narrow focus leads to degrees of a flow state, deep work, and efficiency.

Conscious open focus leads to creativity, relaxation, and a sense of peace. A state where you do not attach to any of the potential thoughts, ideas, emotions, or limits that can pass through your awareness.

The spiritual warrior is one that pushes the limits of both the material and immaterial. They develop their character as much as they stack their achievements. Not the absolute peace of a monk in a secluded monastery, and not the absolute progress of a businessman on a yacht.

Humans have a multitude of characteristics that distinguish them from other beings. It is important that we understand these so we can leverage them in our own lives.

By understanding the Universe from the top down, you will be able to navigate your personal life from a heightened level of mind.

When we harness the creative ability of our minds to view life from above, we can discover, collect, and harness profound insights that bring us peace and progress below.

“God,” as far as we’re concerned, is the identity of reality.

we can understand that the path to the good life cannot be deciphered from one mere human perspective or belief system. You must observe and note patterns from one perspective to another, even if it isn’t a human perspective.

This Universal, or infinite, intelligence reveals itself through division and unity, creation and destruction, birth and death, growth and decay, order and chaos. An impeccable and self- corrective balance.

When you focus on a bolt holding the rim in place, it is a bolt holding the rim in place. Both a whole and a part. A whole in itself and a part of something larger. Humans, by this realization, are a whole, but also a part of something bigger than themselves like a life purpose, a community, or the Universe itself. When we become disconnected from any of the above, we notice a drastic dip in the quality of life.

A unit of mind is anything that can be given attention on any plane of existence.

One notable characteristic of these units is that after a period of conflict, a creative solution emerges, which is a unit in and of itself that transcends and includes that which came before it.

There is one notable pattern with this infinite web of connected dots: division and reunion.

The ideas in your mind divide and reunite; we call this creativity.

In a few centuries, all of our skin may be the same slight shade of what humans perceive as brown, and race as a concept will collapse into one.

Entropy, division, unity, creation, destruction, or the rest can happen in an instant or over the course of generations.

I would encourage you to notice this pattern wherever you can, even when making your breakfast, writing a book, or using the bathroom. Notice the parts, wholes, and how they dance together across the physical globe and ripple through the collective consciousness.

One of the most beneficial habits you can adopt is playing with mental Legos. Sit with an idea, thought, or problem and follow the connections that present themselves. Stay vigilant of distractions. This is how you practice creativity, mindfulness, and deep thinking without any external tools or guides.

The big problem on the cultural, social, and personal level is identification with ideology. Humans group ideas into what is supposed to be indivisible unity of ideas. We leave no room for division and reunion.

Uni-verse. One song. That is what you are smack in the middle of.

The Universe is in perfect harmony. You can fight with it or flow with it, and the ego loves to fight with it.

all information is interpreted through our worldview and perception.

If you are in a low point in life, seek to see the big picture. Understand that the lows are not permanent, they are not unique to you, and they are followed by a season of progress, if you listen to the lesson that life is trying to teach you.

Life unfolds in chapters, phases, and cycles.

Advice, education, and conversation must be interpreted from a shared purpose for it to retain its maximum value.

The unconscious mind is powerful. It’s like a sponge. With every repetition, like flowing water forming the Grand Canyon, our behavior becomes more automatic.

The cycles of the Universe can be brutal; they don’t care about your feelings.

The Universal patterns of storytelling are how we construct meaning, language, and communication.

Language is the signifier of cognitive activity.

Sculptures are stories frozen in time.

Ideas are a novel emergence that offer a direction in which to pave the road of expanded thought, because thought is a program that is limited by the operating system, or language, it operates on.

Struggle is a universal principle. It is silly to think that it isn’t supposed to be a part of your life.

From the highest perspective, resolved conflict leads to creative emergence.

We resist conflict by narrowing our minds on the conflict itself, rather than letting it flow as an interesting, and often necessary, part of existence.

We can begin to see conflict, struggle, or battles as problems within a system. If they are not solved, entropy ensues. When we zoom out, seek to understand the system, and let go of the outcome, we create room for progress. Progress feels good. Incredible, in fact, but in the opposite sense of instant gratification.

We perform mental gymnastics to do anything but face reality.

You can write, and you can write well, regardless of how you feel.

Feelings are feedback, and we should treat them as such.

We live in a delusion that we want to make progress without it being hard.

If you were to be with it, flow with it, and realize that discomfort is a part of the human experience, you would find that your thoughts are the culprit of your suffering.

Of course, there will be seasons where problems seem nonexistent. We get comfortable when life is going well, and we remember these times as reference points that our mind seeks to move back to. Out of nowhere, you may feel lost. You may fall back into bad habits. Entropy will take hold when you let your guard down, and a host of new problems threaten the mental comfort that we love to call home.

Be wary when things are going too well.

Awareness is the first step, universal perspective is the second, and if it is real, accepting the battle for what it is comes last.

Radical acceptance of present- moment reality is the start of the solution to most, if not all, of your perceived problems.

Fight with it until you realize the futility in fighting with fabrication. Then, let go. When you least expect it, the creative breakthrough will come, and the season of intensity will be at your doorstep. It’s not a battle, but a dance.

### II REINVENT YOURSELF

The human superpower is choice. We no longer need to outsource our choices to biological, sociological, or psychological drives.

Modern survival is about mindset. We adopt goals, identify with them, and our behavior changes to achieve, or survive, those goals.

When we unconsciously act to survive an identity that is often greater than ourselves, the pain can be unbearable.

When we use the words “I” or “me,” we are referring to a mental construct.

Through gradual exposure to the world, we layer experiences on top of each other, forming an invisible web of expectations that allow us to understand the world.

The stronger the attachment, the stronger the emotional reaction when that illusory identification is threatened.

Treat negative feelings as a test of awareness. When you feel a disturbance in your inner peace, follow that feeling along the string until you reach the source, which may be much, much deeper than you could ever imagine.

Your field of awareness will register what it perceives as important for its survival.

Our identity shapes our habits, and our habits reinforce our self- image.

Our actions determine who we are, and if we spend the majority of our lives unaware of the identities, perspectives, and accompanying goals we are working to survive, we may end up as a person we hate when we finally decide to wake up.

Most people think they “find” their passion when in reality, they create it by investing mental energy into a goal.

If you wait until you feel passionate enough to act, you will never discover what is truly meaningful to you.

If you don’t have the feedback of progress to remind you that you are on the right path, you begin to feel lost.

Conceptual reproduction is the drive to spread the ideas, beliefs, and biases that make you, you. There is a reason we feel the pull to create.

You feel bad because your future self is watching your every move, and they don’t like what they see.

Everyone has felt the pull. The call to greatness.

most people want to solve the problems of the world before they solve their own. This is a recipe for disaster. How can you help the world if you haven’t helped yourself?

Are you overweight? Do you hate your job? Are you tired all the time? Did you just go through a breakup? Are you trapped in a cloud of negative emotions? You must sit with these problems, observe them from a state of open focus, and become aware of how they impact your life. Then, you must gather the knowledge, skills, and resources that allow you to dive in with clarity in your day- to- day life.

You must hunt for a reason, a “why,” for solving that problem.

With the intrinsic energy from that “why,” you create a goal to overcome that problem. This is your purpose until the next reveals itself.

Intention is a magnet toward a desired future that is enhanced with reason.

If someone has a mind, body, or lifestyle you desire, use that as fuel to educate, execute, and iterate as you learn more about yourself. If somebody has a mind, body, or lifestyle you despise, use that as fuel to push in the opposite direction.

You need a plan. A strategy. A clear set of goals that form a system that, when backed by focused effort, will create a meaningful future.

The paradox here is that to dive inward you must solve superficial problems outward.

### The Game

The skills you acquire will determine the challenges you take on. Those challenges expand your awareness of profitable opportunities.

My generation is notorious for transferring their obsession for video games into the real world. A majority of my colleagues learned how to level up their character, stack gold, and have the discipline to log on every day and repeat the same boring actions that lead to exponential results. It’s no wonder they have multimillion- dollar businesses doing what they enjoy.

The game of life makes sense from a macro perspective. But it is all too common for people to narrow their minds on the micro games of life.

If you can mold your mind to see a situation for what it is, a game, by creating a beneficial end goal, constructing a path to get there, and deciphering the most advantageous actions you can take, even mundane situations can become enjoyable.

You can opt out of playing the game, whether it be social, personal, or anything in between.

Our attention will always gravitate toward a hierarchy of goals, that form a game, to ease the sense of uncertainty that is baked into life itself.

We are all NPCs at times and main characters at others. The goal is to reduce our time spent in the former with time and reflection.

Anything that can be put into words is a self- imposed limit that prevents us from understanding what can’t be put into words.

When you have absolute clarity on how to win and a sprinkle of challenge that matches your skill level, the world goes quiet, and you become at one with the river that is reality.

When you are at one with what’s right in front of you, leaning into the flow of nature, problems lose their weight and nothing else matters.

By understanding the delicate balance of challenge and skill, we can turn a mundane and stressful situation into one of meaning and mastery.

The game is the structure that is reinforced with rules, mechanics, and other nuances that create a mental house that we can navigate with ease. If you don’t zoom out to observe, learn, and understand the structure, you will drown in the technical details of each situation.

You need a challenging end goal that you want to achieve, clarity on how to get there, and a simplified first step to reduce the friction of getting started.

As you push toward your ideal future, you will be forced to upskill to match the challenge that any hierarchy of goals presents.

Be wary of those that put a clear path in front of you.

### The Lens

Everyone has their own unique skills, traits, and specialties. Everyone is a part of their own faction, guild, and group of confidants.

Your ability to mold your mind to understand the goals that others are pursuing from their individual skill level will make you less reactionary (it will also make you more money).

Everyone may seem wrong, but when you take their conscious or unconscious goals into account, they are right.

We see less than a 0.001% of someone’s life and yet we think we understand the complexity of their mind, being, and self.

Even if we see it as someone else’s story, we interpret it as a part of our own, as that is the only way we can make sense of it.

You are a perspective vessel in a subjective reality.

Thinking of yourself as higher, more noble, or less egoic is still a status game that the ego loves to play.

If you hold the perspective of your future self in your mind and focus tightly on a task that will create your vision, distractions won’t register in your field of awareness.

To prepare ourselves to make better decisions in alignment with our goals, we must collect consciousness so we can mold our mind in a way that reduces the friction to act.

You collect consciousness by studying multiple perspectives with the goal of holistic understanding.

When you study different perspectives, you are collecting lenses for your camera.

With time, and as you collect an arsenal of lenses, you become conscious of patterns that are packaged up in an enticing way with a specific label slapped on them. These patterns often represent the fundamentals, principles, and levers that contribute to progress on the Universal scale.

With every level of mind there are less people occupying that state. But when you find them, the connection you have is one that lasts a lifetime.

You must develop a passion for the mind itself if you want to get to the root of existence.

Knowing is not understanding. Knowing implies a label, limit, or distinction that the mind creates.

Understanding your problems means to perceive them from the highest level of mind available to you. From that expanded perspective, you can begin to experiment, iterate, and create a long- term personal solution.

Problems are only problems if you interpret them that way.

When mental battles are at your doorstep, don’t fight with it, flow with it. Pause, zoom out, observe, and when you gain clarity through the intangible resources you’ve acquired, dive back in and execute with focused effort.

Imagine your life potential as the 125 billion bits of information you can process.

As we learn and become more comfortable with any aspect of reality, that information is stored and used by the unconscious mind.

The solution to this endless negative oscillation is education, clarity, and action.

One can begin physical training, but if they don’t evolve beyond the superficial pursuit of looks, the game will collapse and life will lose meaning.

Closed- mindedness encapsulates a host of other problems like distraction, reactivity, surface- level living, falling for get- rich- quick schemes, lack of commitment in business and relationships, and the inability to discover and pursue one’s purpose.

You cannot solve a problem from the same level of mind that created it. At this point, life offers a lesson to your problems, and you break through the perception threshold.

the “runners high,” where one overcomes a mental battle, their mind quiets, and even when it is an extremely difficult situation, one can stick it out without complaint.

### The Formula

Don’t fall into the trap of conscious nobility. Like someone who just learned about the concept of spirituality and uses it as a moral high ground.

A majority of the population hides behind an unconscious moral high ground that contributes to more evil than the conscious individual that attempts to integrate, transmute, and harness their dark energy.

Anyone can dig into the experiences of their past, generate a potent energy source within them,

It’s easier to know what you don’t want– from experience– than it is to know what you want– from imagination.

Create an anti- vision for your future. Write out every single thing you don’t want, why you don’t want it, and how you are going to avoid it.

The highest- paid individuals are the visionaries, strategists, and creative problem solvers of the world.

Purpose is elusive.

A purpose is a meaningful goal.

Your purpose is the most pressing problem in your life at this very moment.

It is close to impossible to act with authenticity when your actions are influenced by need of something outside of yourself.

With the notebook you pulled out earlier, break this big goal, or purpose, into a clear path to gain clarity on your priority actions.

Spend time writing out yearly, monthly, weekly, and daily goals that will actualize the accompanying purpose.

Health, wealth, relationships, and happiness are the 4 domains that allow you to master your survival.

The potential death of who they are is more important than a 10- second indulgence in a treat.

In terms of finding passion for your work, that comes after a specific amount of energy is invested into your work.

If you’re lost, the answer is education. If you’re educated, the answer is execution. If you’re executing, the answer is consistency.

When you feel overwhelmed, lost, or anxious, it is usually because you are projecting too far into the future.

Psychological time is illustrated by our desire to live in the past or future in a way that does not help us but harms us.

Animals seem to live in the eternal present moment.

We live out the same negative experiences over and over again. We literally don’t change.

“tactical stress.” The conscious decision to put yourself in a do- or- die situation, knowing that you have the skill to make it work, and will accept nothing less than success.

Pull an all- nighter. Sign up for a marathon. Book a flight across the globe. Move to a location that demands 3 times more than what you can afford, so you are forced to make your business work. Ask the client for double your normal rates. Do the thing that other people will think you are crazy for doing, because that’s how you make leaps of meaningful progress.

That is one option, and I do not recommend doing it often.

Beyond that, we want to aim for slow, consistent progress that increases our surface area for exponential growth.

As you dig deeper into the unknown, people will look at you differently. They will say, “You’ve changed,” and your only response should be, “Yes, the tiny improvements are starting to add up.”

Extrinsic motivation isn’t bad. It is a useful tool, not a master.

Seek to appreciate every facet of reality you encounter. If you feel the pull to go deeper, seek to understand. When passion is born in your pursuit, attempt to master the craft. From there, know that business is the modern vessel for living with purpose. It only makes sense to monetize what you master with the vast resources available to you in this developed point in civilization.

### The Shift

You can learn, teach, build, and sell with the technology everyone has in their hands.

There is an overwhelming number of options for a better life, so much so that any given person is unaware of 95% of them, and the other 5% still cause anxiety toward the future.

In a world ruled by money, it may not make you happy, but there is a baseline you must reach to sustain a fulfilling lifestyle.

One man’s labor cannot scale, but the creative ability of his mind can.

In my eyes, the college experience is worthwhile.

The main reason people go to college is because they haven’t questioned who they are, what they want, and developed themselves to the point of self- reliance.

Curiosity is the path to doing the things you want to do.

If you are learning the same thing as everyone else, you will fight for the same replaceable opportunities as everyone else.

All it takes is one big idea that registers well with an individual to cause an avalanche in the mind called insight. Insight leads to an exponential leap in consciousness.

The difference between a professor and creator is results.

A “creator” is someone who becomes a fountainhead of value through personal development, shares that value in public, and makes a creative income doing so.

You must prioritize your mind. Mental mastery is how you fight back in a world that wants to steal your attention, manipulate your thoughts, and make you feel helpless.

When you align your search for knowledge with your vision, goals, and present purpose, the potential for distraction decreases dramatically.

The result of personal development is a career that you create, not one that society gives you.

True creatives know that given enough time, they can turn passion into profit while maintaining their authenticity.

most people have a twisted view of entrepreneurship. It’s not about starting the next billion- dollar company. It’s about leveraging your stack of skills, unique story, and finite focus to create a life of meaning.

Every single person should have a foundational understanding of media because it is a microcosm of life itself.

Media is composed of writing, speaking, and visuals that distribute a valuable message.

### The New Rich

Happiness is a skill. It is not given but created. As with all skills, it must be practiced, refined, and adopted as a part of your life.

If you want to be happier, you need to expose yourself to more negative experiences that allow you to create the positive ones.

You can enjoy flashy things. Most people just acquire them for the mindless pursuit of status.

The goals you pursue are the axis of your suffering. Choose them wisely,

Without deliberate practice, the mind will latch onto the past or future in an attempt to make the impermanent permanent.

Work. Does that spark any stressful thoughts about tomorrow? If so, that’s a problem.

All that freedom is, when pertaining to the mind, is the dissolution of barriers that comes from adopting a higher perspective.

You don’t want absolute freedom, you want autonomy. The difference is that freedom implies a lack of structure, where autonomy is your ability to choose within a structure.

Four- hour workdays, singular focus, and meaningful work are becoming the norm in small pockets of the internet, and for good reason.

Four to five hours of work paired with active rest seems to be the sweet spot for most impactful creatives.

Sustainability, consistency, and creativity must be prioritized before we even mention the word “productivity.”

Pull out a journal and take note of how you feel. Write down exactly what you are doing on a daily basis. Every little detail. Take 10 minutes and get specific on what you do, why you do it, and how you feel in the morning, afternoon, and night. This is important for identifying unconscious parasites (time and energy suckers). From your brain dump, prioritize, remove, and restructure.

Prioritize the things that will get results. Remove the things that snuck their way into your day. Restructure specific tasks and obligations to free up more time.

Next, create a weeklong system.

Novel ideas emerge from conflict of the multiple ideas you hold in your mind from study.

If you don’t know where to start, reread the book that changed the way you move in the world; it will do it again.

When the DMN is “activated” through restful, meditative, or open- focused activities, the brain isn’t any less active than it would be when engaged in something like focused work, or something that demands narrow focus and concentrated attention.

When your focus is open, your subconscious mind is still working hard and munching on solving the problems in the way of your goals.

“Shower thoughts” are the method by which the balanced worker shakes the world.

From personal experience, my greatest insights come after a period of struggle.

Competition has its place, but when you are stuck on a problem, the best thing you can do is let reality win.

Fill your mind in the afternoons with books, learning, and conversation. Empty your mind with walks, training, and contemplation. Use your mind in the morning with creation, output, and focus.

If you don’t systemize your path to success, with time and focused effort, you won’t achieve it.

If we don’t live at our edge, a chaotic state of mind is the default.

Every morning, be sure that you are performing tasks that move levers.

Without positive feedback, there is a growing potential for rogue thoughts, emotions, and external stimuli to grab at your attention.

### The Skill Stack

View brands, content, and products from the lens of a researcher, not a consumer,

You have to learn how to capture attention if you want anything (including money) from someone else.

Marketing and sales give you a practical approach to learning about the human psyche in the real world.

Marketing is how you craft a message that is attention- grabbing, relevant, and valuable for a specific person or identity.

Sales is a process for making people aware of their problems, showing them how that problem is impacting their lives, and presenting a solution to achieve their goals.

Your job is to understand a specific group of people, study their problems, reflect on your experience from solving your own, and create a solution in the form of a product to help them reach the next stage.

When you build, market, and sell to yourself, you create a niche of one that others struggle to compete with.

In life, discipline equals freedom. In business, distribution equals freedom.

Distribution comes from the combination of media and code. Technical know- how, paired with the ability to articulate your value, is how anyone can earn an independent income.

Writing is the vehicle for articulated thought and communication.

The message and medium are evergreen, while results- oriented skills change with the landscape.

Trial and error will teach you the same lesson as the masters because that is how they learned it.

“Luck” is a percentage that increases with the amount of people that know your value.

Nothing happens, then everything happens.

One day you have zero dollars, clients, or confidence and the next you have an abundance of them all.

### The Project

Having a perpetual stream of evolving personal projects to work on first thing brought novelty to my days. The discoveries, insight, and progress that I made across multiple domains was the source of my zest for life.

The solutions that you create for any area of your life can be used in 2 useful ways. The first is to free up mental energy in your life so you can build something deeper. The second is to pass along your solutions to those that want to be helped.

You are the infinite project. You are your life’s work.

Without quality ideas, struggle, and time, you will fail to reach new levels of understanding.

When you revisit information from a new level of mind, you notice resources that didn’t originally catch your attention through novelty.

If you don’t use it, you lose it.

The novelty and patterns we noticed are more than likely to inspire us to act, but that inspiration has a short fuse.

You won’t be able to execute on any and all ideas right away. The next best thing is to write it down so you don’t waste that potential.

Teaching what you know, regardless of how much of an imposter you think you are, is how you supercharge your understanding of ideas.

What you’ll find in most domains is that true experts rarely need guidance.

Intuition and direct experience trump all once you get into the advanced stage.

If you want to truly learn, theory must brush up against reality. Start, then learn.

In business, relationships, career development, and anywhere else you need to stand out, the minor distinctions are what give you an advantage.

As your system becomes more efficient with time and mental energy, that problem ceases to bother you, and you can invest your focus in problems that require a higher degree of creativity.

All profitable products start as a project whether the intention to sell is there or not.

The feeling of building your own thing is incredible. I hope you experience it one day.

There is always a better problem to solve.

### The Vessel

As with all pursuits that seem shallow on the surface, there is a depth of wisdom waiting to be discovered.

Money is the barrier to improvement in many areas of life.

Entrepreneurship does not eliminate structure but allows you to take a lifestyle- first approach to creating your own.

If you’d like to build a massive company, that’s a worthy endeavor.

Once you have leverage, you can start a company from a place of low risk and high reputation.

“Done for you,” “done with you,” and “do it yourself” style offers can increase in value and profitability with a developed system that gets results, a strong reputation behind the person selling it, and the previous results you’ve gotten past clients and customers.

Most people have dreams of being the CEO of a successful business but haven’t managed to be the CEO of their own life.

The quickest fix is the longest path.

A modern business can be broken down into 3 core components: brand, content, and product. Your brand is your story. Your content is a map. Your product is a game.

Realize that you do not need results to start.

The easiest way to generate an income is to help people increase their own.

With a problem- oriented service and sales know- how, you can generate a full- time income with 2– 4 clients a month, rather than one hundred to five hundred product sales.

Considering everything goes right, which it won’t, you can expect belief- shattering results within 6– 12 months of focus.

The problem is that most people start a full or side business for the sake of money and money alone.

we can incorporate meaning and fulfillment into your pursuit of money without any setbacks.

Results are determined by behavior change.

It feels good to spread ideas that bring positive change to the lives of people.

Ideas beget execution.

Creativity is infinite, productivity is finite.

You can experience heightened states of creativity along this path but realize that these are states. They are temporary.

Reading, watching, and listening to information that challenges your current ideas, beliefs, and philosophies must become a cornerstone habit in your day, because you may grow attached to those ideas and your self will cease to make progress.

This is how you develop your mind toward infinity.

Desires in general, are not bad. But if you desire to change something that you can’t, it becomes the source of your suffering.

At the edge of the known, with one foot in the unknown, is where we are the most alive.

A primary source of suffering is knowing that you are meant for more.

Everything is information, or in formation.

Value creators are obsessive reality explorers.
