*Born to Run* was a joy to read. I initially picked this book up thinking it would be a cool story about this lost tribe of distance runners — which it was — but it was so much more than that. Packed full of deep characters, suspense, cutting edge science and incredible feats of athletic achievement, *Born to Run* is an epic adventure that illuminates the power of running and its integrality throughout human existence. I found the story to be super engaging and easy to read. Interleaved throughout this story were fascinating deep dives into the science, history and art of running that added so much depth to the book. The writing style is succinct and very easy to read.

# Notes & Quotes

Every morning in Africa, a gazelle wakes up, it knows it must outrun the fastest lion or it will be killed. Every morning in Africa, a lion wakes up.

The reason we race isn't so much to beat each other,... but to be *with* each other.

That was the real secret of the Tarahumara: they'd never forgotten what it felt like to love running. They remembered that running was mankind's first fine art, our original act of inspired creation. Way before we were scratching pictures on caves or beating rhythms on hollow trees, we were perfecting the art of combining our breath and mind and muscles into fluid self-propulsion over wild terrain. And when our ancestors finally did make their first cave paintings, what were the first designs? A downward slash, lightning bolts through the bottom and middle--behold, the Running Man. Distance running was revered because it was indispensable; it was the way we survived and thrived and spread across the planet. You ran to eat and to avoid being eaten; you ran to find a mate and impress her, and with her you ran off to start a new life together. You had to love running, or you wouldn't live to love anything else. And like everything else we love — everything we sentimentally call our 'passions' and 'desires' it's really an encoded ancestral necessity. We were born to run; we were born because we run. We're all Running People, as the Tarahumara have always known.

You don't have to be fast. But you'd better be fearless.

Make friends with pain, and you will never be alone. ~Ken Chlouber, Colorado miner and creator of the Leadville Trail 100 mile race

There are two goddesses in your heart,” he told them. “The Goddess of Wisdom and the Goddess of Wealth. Everyone thinks they need to get wealth first, and wisdom will come. So they concern themselves with chasing money. But they have it backwards. You have to give your heart to the Goddess of Wisdom, give her all your love and attention, and the Goddess of Wealth will become jealous, and follow you.” Ask nothing from your running, in other words, and you’ll get more than you ever imagined.

Perhaps all our troubles - all the violence, obesity, illness, depression, and greed we can't overcome - began when we stopped living as Running People. Deny your nature, and it will erupt in some other, uglier way.

Nearly all runners do their slow runs too fast, and their fast runs too slow." Ken Mierke says. "So they're just training their bodies to burn sugar, which is the last thing a distance runner wants. You've got enough fat stored to run to California, so the more you train your body to burn fat instead of sugar, the longer your limited sugar tank is going to last." The way to activate your fat-burning furnace is by staying below your aerobic threshold — your hard-breathing point — during your endurance runs.

If you don't think you were born to run you're not only denying history. You're denying who you are.
