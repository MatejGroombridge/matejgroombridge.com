In this book, Derek chronicles his “accidental” success and failures and lessons he learnt from creating a business by following his passions. I found this book to be a very inspiring and refreshing business read - Derek takes a very holistic approach to business that I felt I really resonated with. The writing is succinct and easy to read and the whole book is published for free on Derek’s site so you have no reason to not read it.
