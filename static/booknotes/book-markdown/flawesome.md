*Thank you to MindValley for reaching out and providing me with the opportunity to review #BecomingFlawesome.*

## Overview

*Becoming Flawesome* is a guide to finding your way back to your true self. It’s about understanding who you really are, accepting your dents and scratches, your uniqueness and even your flaws.

## Impressions

Kristina Mänd-Lakhiani’s *Becoming Flawesome* provides a comprehensive manual for self-acceptance and self-love. In her book, Kristina shares her own journey from being on top of a personal growth empire to stepping aside and walking the path towards being more honest with herself. The book is packed full of practical techniques and strategies to achieve a similar transformation, providing tactics that can easily be built into ones own life. Baked into this guide was a number of personal anecdotes and reflection prompts that are very helpful in further stimulating personal growth and understanding of oneself. I found the book was very lengthy and could probably be condensed into a much shorter and more digestible length but that is just a personal opinion.

# Summary, Quotes & Notes

The only person who’s rejection you have to fear is your own. As long as you can accept yourself, the world has no choice but to accept you as well. And if it doesn’t, you won’t give a damn anyway.

Your dragons will not cease to exist, no matter how well you build the walls of spirituality around them.

It is on the top of Mount Olympus when you are left alone with the ultimate truth … and your demons for company.

I believe that the biggest problem of contemporary society is emotional analgesia. We learn to ignore emotional pain, focusing on the positive and demanding good vibes only, slapping on band-aids and popping paracetamols to feel better, while our lives break and deteriorate from undetected trauma.

The people that you love do not need your sacrifice - they want you to be happy. Not only is your sacrifice of personal happiness pointless, but it is also a heavy burden on those for whom you so selflessly want to make the offering.

You only have a problem with other people to the extent that you have a problem with yourself.

Transformation is not a natural consequence of pain, it is a sign of healing.

Self-care is about surviving, while self-love is about thriving.

And that, my friends, is how transformation happens - it is when your knowledge is lived through your experience, or when your experience is supported by your knowledge. But ultimately - you will always need both.
