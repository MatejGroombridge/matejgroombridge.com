i suck at writing, my thoughts are muddy, I struggle with communication and 

this means short sentences.

simple language.

and an intentionality to every sentence that I write.

no fluff.

i really want to push back against the expectations of rigidity in punctuation that mark a lot of texts as “good writing” too.

i’m leaving expectations behind and writing in a way that best aligns with my personal ethos. quirky punctuation, strange slang, general messiness — expect it all.

## II    why writing


fear of exposure, curation and growth potential

this website started off like that
    
    a small project that i worked on in my free time
    
    over the years it has become polished

bad writing = muddy thoughts

the future of media

the trap of learning

authenticity and AI

## III    the ethos

so what am i going to write about?

the short answer: anything i really feel like.

originally i wrote this as one long article but decided to split it up into a few. you can read the long answer here: link.

the long answer: i want to optimise for four key areas.

1. intellectual depth
2. a clean, minimalist and clearly digestible tone

this means short sentences.

simple language.

and an intentionality to every sentence that I write.

no fluff.

i really want to push back against the expectations of rigidity in punctuation that mark a lot of texts as “good writing” too.

i’m leaving expectations behind and writing in a way that best aligns with my personal ethos. quirky punctuation, strange slang, general messiness — expect it all.

1. aesthetics

I want to create something beautful here. prose, allegory

i don’t want to constrain myself creatively and so if the opportunity

expect quotes, photography, maybe even music and video to slowly be integrated into the website

1. and transformativeness 
i want my writing to not be stagnant and dull but a vessel for deep insight and personal growth

## III    the constraints

if this is going to be a habit that i develop over the rest of my life, i have to put in place a few principles that will make sticking to my word likely

---


i will write about anything i feel like writing about

no pressure to stick to a group of topics

words on the page first, then editing

i’m throwing out all spelling, grammar and punctuation when writing this 
it can all come later. the priority first and foremost is getting words on paper

no AI

i’m allowing myself a final pass on each article 
to catch grammar and spelling errors

AI is amazing at reducing friction but it comes with the danger of replacing your own thinking

i use AI as a crutch

i could honestly write a pretty long article on all the ways AI has impacted my workflows so I won’t yap on any further.

one article at a time

i can already forsee the temptation to jump around and write about whatever shiny

publish before its perfect

continual feedback and growth

i want to get really really good at writing in a way that connects with people. and this will require lots of learning and iteration. hopefully over the coming months you start to see my writing style really evolve. i’m already experimenting with stuff in this very article: minimal punctuation, varying sentence length, vocab, lists etc.

radical honesty and pushback against curation

i want to tentatively set a goal of one article a week but honestly i don’t know if this is realistic. i’m balancing working full time as an Atlassian software engineering intern with part time university and an incredibly busy college life. relationships, fitness, work, faith and writing are all going to be buckets that compete for my time and investing time in these areas will be just as important as

## IV    the tech

feel free to skip this section if you’re not very technologically inclined but i want to 

since i want to make writing as frictionless as possible, i’m considering a markdown based system

whilst this article was written on notion,

i want some separation between writing articles, my code and the rest of my notetaking which is why i’ve chosen to use typora. it has a beautiful, minimal interface yet the ability to also customise aesthetics under the hood through css. unfortunately it isn’t a free program but i’m willing to fork out the extra $15 since it really suits what i’m going for. as I’ve already said, reducing cognitive load is going to be a major priority and i need to get comfortable putting skin in the game.

choosing the right system is a form of procrastination so i’m not putting too much thought into this.

the system i’ve got right now should work for the near future, if i want to tweak it down the line that’s ok too.

i have plans to update my site’s stylesheets too to make it look aesthetically pleasing but that is not currently a priority.

## V    the future

don’t expect anything good to come from this project. my pieces are going to be very mediocre. not bad at best.

expect cliches, cringe and generally just the jankiness that comes with trying out something new. this is a challenge but I want to commit to being bad publicly.

this is how I’m framing it: every time I publish something I worked hard on that isn’t perfect, I win. while a big part of my goal is to write a good article, more important than that i want to kill the part of me that requires everything i do to look curated and effortless and actually put some skin in the game.

i know if i found out a friend of mine is writing articles in public i’d find that pretty weird myself. i do genuinely value my own growth in this creative space and so i ask that 

if you’re a friend reading this i lowkey

but i think i’m on the right track. i’ve come to learn that fear and resistance is a great barometer for where you need to spend time. i’ve felt crazy inspired writing this up, a way that i haven’t felt about a project in a while. i get a similar fire to running a half marathon on a random tuesday, publishing a whole bunch of photography or cycling in the rain across the blue mountains. hopefully you agree that this is pretty cool and don’t take anything i do too seriously.

this is also a practice in somewhat divorcing myself from my craft

i’m also aware that whilst this is the first article i’m going to publish, it’s unlikely to be the hardest. an introductory article is easy. there’s a clear structure and a lot to say.
